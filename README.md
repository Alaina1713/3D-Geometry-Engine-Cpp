# 3D Geometry Engine in C++

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This is a **3D Geometry Engine** written in C++ that allows you to model basic 3D objects, calculate their **volume**, **surface area**, and **bounding boxes**, and perform simple queries on a scene. The project is designed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, file handling, and the C++ Standard Library (STL).  

This project is **perfect for a resume**, showing practical skills in C++, OOP, file I/O, and modular code design.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
- Supports multiple 3D objects:  
  - Sphere  
  - Cube  
  - Cylinder  
- Calculates **volume** and **surface area** for each object.  
- Computes **bounding boxes** for spatial queries.  
- Reads input scene data from a file (`scene.txt`).  
- Outputs results to a file (`results.txt`).  
- Fully modular and easy to extend with additional 3D shapes.  
- Demonstrates **shared pointers** and STL containers.
